            <h3>The legend of the witches' road</h3>
            <p class="content">The legend says the road was created by a circle of twelve witches 
                who gathered under a blood moon centuries ago. They sought to connect the physical world with the mystical, 
                weaving spells into the very stones and trees that line the path. Their goal was not conquest or destruction 
                but the preservation of magical knowledge and harmony between realms.
                <br>
                The legend says that there is a ballad of witches, and nowadays, this is the closest audio we found.
